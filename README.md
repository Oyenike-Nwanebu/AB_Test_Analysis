This project aims to analyse the result of an A/B test conducted on the subscription service cancellation page of a company.

## Background Information
An A/B test on the cancellation page of the subscription service was recently ran. Before running the test, members were able to cancel using a simple web form. The experiment aims to measure the impact of forcing members to phone-in to the customer service line in order to cancel.

Information about the A/B test:
- control group (0) can cancel using a web form
- test group (1) can only cancel by calling in
- Users were randomly assigned to a group when they go to the websites cancel page for the first-time
- The distribution probabilty between both groups is uneven
- Additional transactions generated after users were randomized were recorded
- REBILLs are Transactions recurring payments that were processed
- CHARGEBACKs or REFUNDs transactions represent payments that were cancelled

## Results

### What is the approximate probability distribution between the test group and the control group
After cleaning and analyzing the data, it was discovered that the subsription service members were distributed in approximately 75.2% to 24.8% control group to test group ratio as shown in the bar chart below:

![Probability Distribution](https://github.com/Oyenike-Nwanebu/AB_Test_Analysis/blob/master/Data/Prob_Distribution.png?raw=true)

To determine whether a user belonging to the test group was more likely to generate more revenues, welch test was used to determione statistical significance since there is an imbalance between the two sample groups

## Information About the Data
The required data-sets for this analysis are in the current git repo. They are  split into the following 2 csv files:
- [testSamples.csv](testSamples.csv)
- [transData.csv](transData.csv)

In testSamples.csv, there is a list of unique users that were randomized in the A/B test.
* sample_id : is the unique identifier for the sample
* test_group : is the group in which the sample was placed, 0= control group, 1=test group

In transData.csv, there is a list of transactions generated by randomized users after their randomization:
* transaction_id : is the unique identifier for the transaction
* sample_id : is a foreign key that links transactions to test samples
* transaction_type : is the transaction type for a transaction, can be REBILL, CHARGEBACK or REFUND
* transaction_amount : is the amount generated for a transaction, this can be a negative value

## Analysis Requirements

In this analysis we would like you to answer the following questions:

1. What is the aproximate probability distribution between the test group and the control group
2. Is a user that must call-in to cancel more likely to generate at least 1 addition REBILL?
3. Is a user that must call-in to cancel more likely to generate more revenues?
4. Is a user that must call-in more likely to produce a higher chargeback rate(CHARGEBACKs/REBILLs)?
